        Microsoft has many different locations all over the world. Just within the UK, the company has 6 different offices. Microsoft UK was founded in 1982 and continues to grow. These offices provide jobs to over 3,000 people. They stand behind the traditional Microsoft vision “to empower every person and organization to achieve more”. They are also very well invested in making the life around them (within the UK) better by continuing to lend their tools to education, business, and society.
        Within education they have provided funding and different tools to empower the teachers and students to learn the basics of computer science. This means a lot more than just programming as it also includes how to think when creating or designing something. Some tools include QuickStart (for teachers) and Kodu (364,00 students 7-14). On top of this £334,000 has gone into funding to help train teachers how to use these tools within their curriculum.
        When it comes to the business realm, Microsoft Ventures Accelerator in London has given the opportunity to 17 different startups to develop. While 2,943 active startups are using BizSpark. They also want to make sure SMEs (small and medium enterprises) have the best opportunity to compete. They believe that these SMEs are the “key” to the future of UK’s prosperity. By providing things such as the cloud or Office 365, Microsoft UK can shorten the gap between the bigger competitors and the smaller ones.
        In society Microsoft UK focuses on teaching online safety, giving to charities, inspiring the youth, and digital inclusion. They have been opening a whole world of opportunities to children of all backgrounds to make sure that they all have the same chances as others. They have donated large amounts of money and time to help teach and learn what they need to do to help their communities.
