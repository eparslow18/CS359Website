    I read a couple articles regarding renewable energy in the UK. The first one was about the lake reservoir that is named after a Queen Elizabeth II is now hosting a 10,000 acre floating solar farm. this is great to hear because it only covers less than 10% of the lake but it will power more than 1300 homes in London. I am always interested in finding out more about renewable energy across the globe so this article really intrigues me. I'm glad to see that the UK is trying to make moves toward sustainability. 
    The other article was about how they are starting to increase the green tax which is a tax that is placed on energy bills and it is going to increase without any subsidy of the government. This is going to post some new challenges for people who want to support sustainability but don't have the financial stability to do so. I think that this tax should be subsidized more by the U.K. government. It seems to be an important tax that us in support of green energy sourcing. The energy crisis is worldwide and governments 
    should be spending a lot more money on promoting or researching ways of creating sustainable and renewable energy. In the US currently we are looking more into solar farms and solar powering because the military has taken a great interest in doing this. I think that this is a great opportunity to learn more about making Solar energy more dominant however it's going to be a challenge to encourage all first world countries to do this especially if the militaries or other large entities of the government aren't taking an interest in this. I am interested to see what it's going to be like in London and in Cardiff and find out what their energy usage is and how much of that is from renewable resources.
