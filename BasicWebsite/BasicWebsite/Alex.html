        BBC News had released an article on September 21th, 2017, titled “Nine million people still make or receive calls while driving”. The article was written to address the fact that the usage of phone was still high even though the penalties were amplified back in March of 2017. The numbers pointed out that 40% of people check their text, email, and social media while behind the wheel during traffic. Also, there were 23% of drivers who had admitted that they make and receive illegal phone calls while driving. That makes up 9.2 million of 40 million drivers. This changes of the law obviously didn’t make too much of a difference as only 1 in 10 drivers said they didn’t know about the changes.
        According to another article that was linked, titled “Drivers receive new increased mobile phone penalties”, the penalties for driving while using a mobile included a six points added to your driving record (up from 3) and €200 fine. In 2015 mobiles had been to blame in 22 deaths and 99 serious injuries when driving, one of those cases was a lorry driver going to jail for 10 years after killing a mother and three children.
        Phone usage while driving in the US has been one of the greatest contributors to vehicle crashes. Just recently in Washington state new laws have been passed to make driving while on the phone a DUI-E (or driving under the influence of electronics). Starting off at $136 the first offense then jumping up to $234 for the next offense.  On top of this insurance companies will keep track of these offenses and charge you for them as well. I think the enforcement of these new laws are great. I’ve always thought that there is no human special enough to get away with being drunk or high, texting, or having any other distraction when behind the wheel. When someone becomes a driver they are responsible for their own lives as much as the millions of other people that are on the road. It is a privilege to have a driver’s license, and should be stripped from someone if they aren’t able to give the road their full attention. It saddens me to see that in the UK the number of drivers who receive and make calls is still around 23%, and although that is down from 31% there is still more than 9 million drivers who are putting others at risk. I believe the fines should be much higher than they currently are in order to get more drivers to quit using their phone. Money can always be replaced, but lives can’t. I also like the fact that the points received on a driving record were doubled to 6. Apparently if you get 12 or more points over a three year period you can have your driver’s license revoked (2 years for new drivers). I would like to see a study on drivers who have been caught once, and whether they still do it or not.
